Scrapes the City of Austin's Construction Permits endpoint and stores the data on GitHub. The endpoint has major limitations like only allowing you to access seven days of data at a time. Data is scraped from http://www.austintexas.gov/oss_permits/permit_report.cfm on a daily basis.

A few months after this project was started, the City of Austin started  started publishing permits to their open data portal at https://data.austintexas.gov/Permitting/Building-Permits/q7kv-7293.
