  <h3>Open Austin Monthly Events:</h3>
  <p>If you have an interest in improving our city through the use of data, technology, and design there is space for you. We encourage folks of all backgrounds and skill level to join us at our events to contribute their ideas and expertise. </p>
  <ul>
          <li><b>Community Action Night</b> - Coming to a Community Action Night is the easiest way to get started with Open Austin. First we do introductions and announcements. Then we invite people to pitch projects and discussion ideas. From there, folks break out into groups and get to work. Newbies will get onboarded with Civic Hacking 101 and food and drinks are provided.</li> 
    <li><b>Open Gov & Civic Tech Meetup</b> - A monthly meetup for anyone interested in learning more about the growing Open Government and Civic Technology movement in Austin. From lightning talks to workshops, expect a wide variety of topics that intersect data, design, technology, and government.</li>
      <li><b>Civic Hack Saturday</b> - Civic Hack Saturday is an open study hall space. This is a casual environment to socialize and cowork with fellow Austinites.</li>
  </ul>
