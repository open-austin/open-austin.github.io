<div class="upcoming-events post-content">

  <p>Every month Open Austin hosts three major events:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Open Gov &amp; Civic Tech Meetup</b> - A monthly event were we invite speakers from the civic tech community and cover a broad range of topics. This is normally at the Terrazas public library in East Austin.</li>
          <li><b>Civic Hack Night</b> - We try to invite a non-profit or anybody with an idea for a civic tech project to come pitch their ideas. Then we break out into project-specific groups and work for about two hours. Normally at WeWork on 6th &amp; Congress.</li>
          <li><b>Civic Hack Saturday</b> - Like the Civic Hack Night but on Saturday's and without presentations. This is a comfortable space to come and work on a project for a few hours. Usually at Urban Co-Lab.</li>
      </ul>
  <p>In addition, every year we host three larger events. We could probably use another sentence or two here.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Code Across</b> - What is Code Across and why do we do it? Write a sentence or two about it.</li>
      <li><b>Hack For Change</b> - What is Hack For Change and why do we do it? Write a sentence or two about it.</li>
      <li><b>Ship It Weekend</b> - What is Ship It Weekend and why do we do it? Write a sentence or two about it.</li>
  </ul>
