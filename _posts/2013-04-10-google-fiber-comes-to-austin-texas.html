<p>Today <a title="Google Fiber Blog: Google Fiber’s Next Stop: Austin, Texas" href="http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/google-fibers-next-stop-austin-texas_9.html" target="_blank">Google Fiber announced</a> that Austin would be the second region to receive its gigabit Internet service. With speeds up to 100 times faster than the average home connection, Google Fiber is big news for our city.</p>
<p>Open Austin Steering Committee members Chip Rosenthal and Kye Hittle were on hand for the announcement at Brazos Hall in downtown Austin today.</p>
<p>Open Austin expresses deep gratitude to everyone from city/state government, local business and non-profit organizations who worked to bring Google Fiber to Austin. Along with many others, we can't wait to see what our community does with broadband Internet access available in every home.</p>
