<p>This morning, WOAI Radio in San Antonio ran a story on the recently announced Day of Civic Hacking, and our efforts to convene an Austin event.</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Government has announced their sponsorship of National Civic Hacking Day. An entire weekend in June will be devoted to giving techies from all over the country a chance to lend their expertise in helping local government with various technological projects.</p>
<p>Three different government agencies have already signed on: The Census Bureau, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Labor. Chip Rosenthal with Open Austin, an open citizen volunteer group aimed at helping improve local government, says movements like these are becoming more popular.</p></blockquote>
