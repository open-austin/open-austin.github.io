<p>The ATX Civic Hackathon III, held yesterday, was a great success. The opening session began at 10am, and hackers worked all day, with final presentations at 6pm.</p>
<p>Over 36 hackers participated. Many more people dropped in during the day, to check on progress, and to provide support -- sometimes moral, sometimes technical and sometimes beer. Several City of Austin employees visited, including staff members from <a href="http://austintexas.gov/department/communications-and-technology-management">Communication and Technology Management</a> (IT) and the<a href="http://austintexas.gov/department/austin-resource-recovery"> Austin Resource Recovery</a> (trash/recycling). Also, City of Austin Councilmember <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/place-1/biography">Chris Riley</a> visited the hackers.</p>
<p><strong>Feb 28 update:</strong> <em>Government Technology</em> posted an "International Open Data Day" <a href="http://www.govtech.com/e-government/Early-Results-International-Open-Data-Day-2013.html">wrap-up article</a> that cited our event, and featured wireframe drawings from the Recycling App group.</p>
<p><strong>Another Feb 28 update:</strong> <em>Code for America</em> posted a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013/02/27/coding-across-america-in-2013/">wrap-up article</a> about summarizing happened around the country during "Code Across" weekend.</p>
<p>Four projects were worked on by the hackers. They were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frugal RSVP</li>
<li>Project Breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Proposed Legislature</li>
<li>Recycling Pickup App</li>
</ul>
<p>The event wiki provides a record of the day's events. You can see what happened, including the results from the four workgroups here: <a href="http://atxcivichack3.wikispaces.com/">http://atxcivichack3.wikispaces.com/</a></p>
