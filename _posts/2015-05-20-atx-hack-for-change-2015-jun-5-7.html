<p>Join a multitude of other hackers, visionaries and civic-minded individuals at Austin's third annual ATX Hack for Change. This is the city's largest hackathon for civic and social good.</p>
<p>Local civic leaders will present pitches for the tools they need to fulfill their missions as agents of change in Austin. All you have to do is choose a challenge that fits your skill set, passions, and curiosity. Projects will address a wide variety of social and civic issues: anything from public transit to feeding the hungry, from helping protect the environment to promoting government transparency.</p>
<p>Last year’s ATX Hack for Change brought together over 200 civic and social innovators to create two dozen social good and civic applications and projects that continue to provide meaningful impact for Austinites across the city. Coinciding with the (National Day of Civic Hacking)[http://hackforchange.org/], this year’s event aims to bring even more diverse skillsets to the table to solve our city’s complex challenges — both tech-related and not.</p>
